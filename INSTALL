Future releases of pacc will be autoconfiscated.

For this release:

- to build pacc, and perform the pacc3 basic sanity check: make

- to run the test suite: make check

- to run an individual test: cd test; ./run.sh emit/mk-class0.c

Nothing is automatically installed; here's a reasonable set of commands to copy
and paste for a FHS-compliant system.

 cp pacc /usr/local/bin
 cp doc/pacc.man /usr/local/share/man/man1/pacc.1
 cp doc/pacc.info /usr/local/share/info &&
   gzip /usr/local/share/info/pacc.info
