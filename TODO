Error handling

    Need to check what baf says about this. Intuitively, a good place to
    start is with the rule that failed to match at the highest column.
    Also, need to somehow get line numbers. It's not so obvious how /
    where you could keep a count as parsing proceeds, but there's no
    real reason not to count newlines after an error has been
    encountered, is there?.
