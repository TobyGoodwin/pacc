Error handling

    This needs more experience. Currently, the merging of errors
    destroys more information than I'm happy with.  Also, need to
    somehow get line numbers. It's not so obvious how / where you could
    keep a count as parsing proceeds, but there's no real reason not to
    count newlines after an error has been encountered, is there?.

Complete the command-line interface

    Need --help for one. And --defines, although I'm inclined to think
    that that should be the default.

Detect (and handle?) left recursion

    How does Piumarta do this?

Make pacc output a complete parser

    In other words, get rid of the -part.c bodge. Thing is, it's really
    tempting to have a template file, rather than a rash of printf()s,
    but that's a bit more work. Hell, no, it's essential to have a
    template file. It's only a little bit of work to set it up, and then
    we win every time.

Replace the intermediate results matrix with hashing

Review of the parsing engine - do we really need so many stacks?

Autoconfiscation

Only one instance of each type per union

Handle void types

Dynamically allocate everything

Parser optimization / manipulation (including partialization hack)

UTF-8 support
