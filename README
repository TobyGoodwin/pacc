WARNING: Beta release. There are no known major deficiencies, but
several minor ones. Any interfaces are subject to change in future
releases, and backwards compatibility will not be the highest priority.

pacc is intended to become the parser-generator of choice for C for
the early- to mid-21st century: widely portable, industrial strength,
blazingly fast, parsimonious, and still elegant. So head on over to
the INSTALL file, and found out how to build yourself a small slice of
computer science history.
