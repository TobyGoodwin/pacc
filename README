backwards compatibility will not be the highest priority.

pacc is intended to become the parser-generator of choice for C for the
early- to mid-21st century: widely portable, industrial strength,
blazingly fast, parsimonious, and still elegant. So head on over to the
INSTALL file, and found out how to build yourself a small slice of
computer science history.
