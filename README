WARNING: Alpha release. This release is incomplete, buggy, and poorly
documented! Furthermore, any interfaces are subject to change in future
releases, and is is unlikely that backwards compatibility will be a high
priority.

Having said that, it generally seems to work pretty well!

pacc is intended to become the parser-generator of choice for C for the
early- to mid-21st century: widely portable, industrial strength,
blazingly fast, parsimonious, and still elegant. So head on over to the
INSTALL file, and found out how to build yourself a small slice of
computer science history.
