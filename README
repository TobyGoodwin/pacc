pacc - a compiler compiler

pacc is a compiler compiler, somewhat like yacc (or bison). Its input is
a description of a grammar, and its output is a C function that
recognizes strings of that grammar. The significant technical difference
is this: yacc reads a context-free grammar, and writes a LALR(1)
parser; pacc reads a parsing expression grammar (PEG), and writes a
packrat parser.
