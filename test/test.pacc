# Regression. Eventually, some day, pacc should notice that rule A
# never produces a value, and so it is an error to bind a name to
# it. However, we're not that clever yet. It is important, though,
# that the parser terminates! Till 2009-10-13 it didn't, because
# "evaluating" a rule with no exprs left that rule in the state
# "parsed", and never shifted it to "evaluated".

P ← a:A { 5 }
A ← "5"
